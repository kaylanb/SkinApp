###Instructions

*Click on the 4 Links at the top to navigate around

*Click on "Show_Test_Data"
**This shows 1 of 200 images (selected randomly) from our Test Data Set. Both "HOG" and "Blob" classifiers were trained on the same 300 image Training Data Set.
**You select what you see in the image, hit the "analyze" button, and the HOG/Blob results are output.
**To keep doing this for new images, hit the "yes" button at bottom

*Click on "Upload_Local_Image"
**Upload an image from you computer, select what you see in the image, hit "analyze" button
**WAIT for ~ 10-20 sec, it runs the trained HOG and Blob classifiers on your image so takes a bit, then HOG and Blob results output, and additional info for how each classifier works

###Next Steps
*Add text describing the project, how the classifiers work, about us, links to github, etc.
*Think of how turn into game. Maybe show histogram "live" of how many correct HOG classifier gets correct versus Blob classifier versus User
*CSS files to make it look awesome
